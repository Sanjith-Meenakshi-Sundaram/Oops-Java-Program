## Class Definition

### Basic Student Class Structure
```java
class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String course;
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Defines a blueprint for Student objects
- Instance variables → stored in Heap when we create an object
- They are private → can only be accessed via getters/setters

## Encapsulation 🛡️

### What is Encapsulation?
**Definition:** Hiding the data (variables) inside the class and controlling access via methods.

**How:** Using private fields + public getters/setters or controlled methods.

**Focus:** "How the data is accessed/modified is hidden."

### ❌ Problem with Public Variables
```java
class Student {
    public int id;
    public String name;
}

// Usage - Direct access allows invalid data
Student s = new Student();
s.id = -5;   // ❌ invalid data (id should not be negative)
s.name = ""; // ❌ empty name allowed
```

**Problem:** No control over how variables are read or modified.

### ✅ Solution with Private Variables + Getters/Setters
```java
class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    // Getter
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    // Setter with validation
    public void setId(int id) {
        if (id > 0) {          // ✅ only allow positive IDs
            this.id = id;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid ID");
        }
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        if (name != null && !name.isEmpty()) { // ✅ prevent null/empty names
            this.name = name;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid name");
        }
    }
}
```

### 🏦 Real-Life Example: Bank Account
Think of your bank account balance:
- Your balance is **hidden** inside the bank's system
- You can't directly change it — you can only deposit or withdraw money using **controlled processes**
- This is just like private variables with getters and setters → only valid operations are allowed

## Abstraction 🎭

### What is Abstraction?
**Definition:** Hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features.

**How:** Using abstract classes or interfaces in Java.

**Focus:** "What the object does is exposed, but how it does it is hidden."

### Example: Abstract Shape Class
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // only defines WHAT to do
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {  // implementation hidden from user
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Square");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s = new Circle(); // reference is abstract
        s.draw();  // we don't care HOW it's drawn
    }
}
```

### 🏧 Real-Life Example: ATM Machine
Think of using an ATM machine:
- You just see simple options: **Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance**
- You don't know how the ATM internally connects to the bank server, verifies your PIN, checks your balance, or dispenses money
- You only care about **what** the ATM does, not **how** it does it

## Encapsulation vs Abstraction Comparison

| Feature | Encapsulation 🛡️ | Abstraction 🎭 |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Meaning** | Hides data (variables) | Hides implementation details |
| **Achieved by** | private fields + getters/setters | abstract classes, interfaces |
| **Focus** | Control access to data | Show only essential behavior |
| **Example** | Bank balance hidden in private var | ATM shows withdraw() method, hides internal logic |

## Polymorphism ⚡

### What is Polymorphism?
**Definition:** One thing in many forms. The same method can perform different tasks depending on the input or the object.

### 🔹 Real-Life Example
Think of a person:
- At home → they are a **parent**
- At office → they are an **employee**  
- At a shop → they are a **customer**

👉 **Same person, but behaves differently depending on the situation = Polymorphism**

### HR-Friendly Explanation
> "Polymorphism in Java means one thing in many forms. For example, the same method can perform different tasks depending on the input or the object. In real life, a person is the same, but can be a parent, employee, or customer in different situations. Similarly, in Java, polymorphism helps us write flexible and reusable code."

## Key Rules and Best Practices

### Class Structure
```java
class Student {  // <- ENTITY
    private int id;      // <- ATTRIBUTES
    private String name; // <- ATTRIBUTES
}

int a = 5; // <- VARIABLES
```

### ArrayList Implementation
```java
public void addStudent(Student s) {
    students.add(s);
}
```

### 🔹 Visualization: ArrayList Storage
```
students ArrayList
   ┌───────────┬───────────┐
   │ index 0   │ index 1   │
   ├───────────┼───────────┤
   │ ref to s1 │ ref to s2 │
   └───────────┴───────────┘
         │           │
         ▼           ▼
   [Student]    [Student]
    id=1         id=2
    name=Ram     name=Sita
```

**Key Point:** The ArrayList doesn't contain the Student objects directly, it contains references (addresses) that point to objects stored in the heap.

### 📌 Java File Rules
**Rule:** 
- Only **one public class** is allowed per `.java` file
- The file name must **exactly match** that public class name

**Why this rule exists:**
- Which class should map to the file name?
- Which class should be loaded when you say `java FileName`?

### 🔎 Analogy: House with Main Door
Think of `public class` like your main door in a house:
- You can have only **one main entrance** (so visitors know where to enter)
- Inside the house, you can have many **internal rooms** (non-public classes)  
- But only **one door** is visible to the outside world

## Quick Reference

### 🔒 Encapsulation
**HR-friendly explanation:** 
> "Encapsulation is like putting data in a capsule — we hide the internal details and only allow controlled access. It increases security and prevents misuse of data."

### 🎭 Abstraction  
**HR-friendly explanation:**
> "Abstraction focuses on what an object does, not how it does it. It simplifies complex systems for the user by hiding unnecessary details."

### ⚡ Quick One-Liner Difference
- **Encapsulation** → Hides the **data**
- **Abstraction** → Hides the **implementation**
